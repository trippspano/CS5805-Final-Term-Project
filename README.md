This repo includes my code and report for my Machine Learning I course at Virginia Tech taught by Prof Reza Jafari.

The project applies machine learning techniques, primarily data cleansing, EDA and feature selection, regression, classification, and clustering/association anaylsis, to a real dataset of Olympic athletes.

The report discusses the methodologies and purposes for this project, and I suggest skimming through that for more details.

All of the results can be generated by running main.py file. I would recommend running the regression analysis separately, as printing the model takes up about 800 lines in the terminal. Or redirecting stdout to a file.

For running and tinkering with specific code sections, there are examples of setting up in each file.
